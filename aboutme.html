Hello. My name is Nursyafiqah binti Muhamad Radzi. Most of my friends call syafiqah but my family call me kakak. I am 21 years old. I was born on 6 April 2003 in Hospital Sik, Kedah. I have 5 siblings and I am the eldest. I live in Kampung Kuala, Sik.</p>
<br>
I would describe myself as introvert and quiet when i'm with someone new or stranger. I don't realy like to working with partner, unless they are my friends or I feel comfortable around them. But I generally like to do things on my own. I don’t really know if I’ve accomplished all that much in life. I like to listening music and drawing. Most of the time I like to sleep a lot. I am a nice person as long as they are nice to me.</p>
<br>
Some weaknesses I have is I’m not so strong physically, I’m very quiet, I’m a procrastinator, and I’m an overthinker. I wish I was more physically stronger, so I can defend myself in case I ever get attacked out of nowhere one day. I tend to be very quiet when talking to people, and it’s either they can’t hear me most of the time, or I have a hard time speaking to them. I’m trying to overcome it, but it’s a very difficult process for me. I was huge procrastinator ever since I started Kindergarten. My motto was "Have fun and do work later".</p>
<br>
I am good at cooking. I love cooking so much. Besides that, I am a fast runner also and I an athletics. I am expert in running.</p></h3>
